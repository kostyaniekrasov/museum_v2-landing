This project requires Node.js version 14. Please follow the steps below to set up the project locally.

# Landing Page Description
This landing page for the National Art Museum of Ukraine (NAMU) informs visitors about current exhibitions, upcoming events, and provides online ticket purchasing options. It features museum operating hours, details about exhibitions, and news updates.

# What I learned
### Responsive Design: Using CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptable layouts.
### Sass: Structuring styles with the preprocessor for better code organization and reuse.
### Animations and Interactions: Implementing pseudo-elements and transitions for smooth animations.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Setup

### 1. **Check Node.js version**

First, check if you have Node.js installed and if it's version 14. Open your terminal and run:

```
node -v
```

If the output shows a different version than 14, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, skip to step 3.

### 2. **Install NVM (Node Version Manager)**

If you don't have Node.js version 14 installed, you can use NVM to install and manage multiple Node.js versions. Follow the instructions on the [NVM GitHub repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to install NVM for your operating system.

After installing NVM, run the following command to install Node.js version 14:

```
nvm install 14
```

**Use Node.js version 14**
Once you have Node.js version 14 installed, you need to tell NVM to use it for this project:

```
nvm use 14
```

### 3. **Run project locally**

Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server:

```
npm start
```

This will start the server and make the project available at `http://localhost:3000` (or a different port specified in the project configuration).

**Now you should have the project running locally with Node.js version 14.**
